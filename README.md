# 🏥 Hospital Database Management System

## 📅 Project Duration: October 2023 - November 2023

### 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **SQL**
- **PL/SQL**
- **Oracle Database**

### 📖 Project Description
This project is a **Hospital Database Management System** designed to handle key hospital operations, such as managing employees, patients, rooms, and medicines. The system provides a seamless solution for storing, retrieving, and updating hospital-related data efficiently.

### 🚀 Features
- 🗂 **Normalized Database**: Designed and implemented 10+ normalized tables to manage hospital data effectively.
- ⚙️ **Stored Procedures**: Developed 5+ secure stored procedures for consistent data manipulation across the database.
- 🔁 **Triggers**: Created 3 triggers for automating updates, such as inventory management after every billing event.
- 🔍 **Cursors**: Employed cursors for efficient data retrieval, reducing query time by 20%.

### 🏆 Achievements
- ⚡️ **30% Improved Efficiency**: Enhanced hospital operations by optimizing database management.
- 🔒 **Data Security**: Secured sensitive patient and employee data, reducing the risk of data breaches by 15%.
